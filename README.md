# AGBClient
Custom Minecraft Client for PVP

This client is something i'm working on for personal use. The end goal here is a lightweight client that can be used with the default minecraft launcher whilst still having certain features exclusive to proprietary clients like Lunar and Badlion.

PLEASE NOTE: THE PROJECT DIRECTORY IS AGBClient/workspace, NOT THE ROOT DIRECTORY.
